[mod-setting-description]
fpftheme-furnace-spawning=Crucial for mod. If disabled then game shall never spawn furnaces, useful for maps that you do not want furnaces to be spawned
fpftheme-furnace-upgrade-power-max=Infinite technology cannot be implemented due to technical reasons but can be faked, yet requires a limit value for entities. The value presented here shall be final infinite technology limit. 0 to disable furnace power upgrade technology. Large numbers are not recommended!
fpftheme-furnace-upgrade-eff-max=Infinite technology cannot be implemented due to technical reasons but can be faked, yet requires a limit value for entities. The value presented here shall be final infinite technology limit. 0 to disable furnace efficiency upgrade technology. Large numbers are not recommended!
fpftheme-furnace-upgrade-power-upgrade=Fake-Infinite Furnace Power upgrade bonus in MW per infinite technology researched (ex: 3 for +3MW)
fpftheme-furnace-upgrade-eff-upgrade=Fake-Infinite Furnace Efficiency upgrade bonus in % per infinite technology researched (ex: 5 for %5)
fpftheme-debug=Debug prints
fpftheme-logging=Log some messages and internal stuff to a log file
fpftheme-furnace-spawn-baserate=Base Furnace spawn rate (%) at every chunk explored and created
fpftheme-furnace-spawn-mindistance=Every furnace is far away from each other and after this distance, at every chunk explored the probability shall count 
fpftheme-furnace-spawn-accdistance=Every furnace spawned shall add more distance to the existing ones. with each furnace spawned, farther new ones shall be potentially spawned
fpftheme-furnace-spawn-rateincrement-perchunk=At every chunk distance to the existing furnaces, the probability shall increment by this value
fpftheme-namedentities=Every furnace type will have its power and effectivity in name. since all furnaces are updated at the same time it is not so important
fpftheme-spawn-warning=Game seems to have furnaces but setting for spawning furnaces seems to be off. Check settings to sync the behavior.
fpftheme-dont-disable-alternate-power=Keeps alternate Factorio power options enabled (like steam/nuclear power, solar energy)
fpftheme-spawn-enabled=Setting for spawning big furnaces is active! If you want to prevent it then uncheck setting and reload the game. 
fpftheme-spawn-disabled=Setting for spawning big furnaces is disabled! If you want furnaces to be spawned then check setting and reload the game. 
fpftheme-dont-change-oil-recipes=Replaces water with steam on following recipes (because water is frozen so it has to be heated first): Advanced Oil, Heavy Oil Cracking, Light Oil Cracking, Sulfur
fpftheme-dont-change-effectivity-modules=Effectivity 2 / 3 modules have %10 / %20 speed bonus and %50 / %70 consumption reduction to make them more useful

fpftheme-spawn-furnace=Spawns a furnace at specified chunk. expects arg: \n{ \nchunkPos = <position of chunk, {x = #, y = #}, optional, shall use player location by default >, \nsurface = <surface name, nil for player surface>, \nfurnace_name = <name of furnace if set, or nil for default one>, \ncrater = <optional, crater name, string> \n} 
fpftheme-replace-furnaces=Replaces all furnaces to mentioned type. expects arg: furnace entity type name or empty for current one
fpftheme-read-crater=Tries to read a crater from map and outputs it to script_output. \nexpects arg (write as string): \n{\n name = <name of the crater, shall be file name, string>, \nversion = <version value for crater, string>, \nradius= <a radius distance to check from reference points, int>, \nvariance <optional, how much the furnace at reference point can move towards other directions, int> = { north = <#>, south = <#>, west = <#>, east = <#> } \n}
