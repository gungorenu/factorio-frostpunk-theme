fpf-furnace-spawn-rateincrement-perchunk=Furnace distance probability increment per chunk (%)
fpf-namedentities=Separate name for Furnaces
fpf-dont-disable-alternate-power=Do not disable alternate power options 

[mod-setting-description]
fpf-furnace-spawning=Crucial for mod. If disabled then game shall never spawn furnaces, useful for maps that you do not want furnaces to be spawned
fpf-furnace-upgrade-power-max=Infinite technology cannot be implemented due to technical reasons but can be faked, yet requires a limit value for entities. The value presented here shall be final infinite technology limit. 0 to disable furnace power upgrade technology. Large numbers are not recommended!
fpf-furnace-upgrade-eff-max=Infinite technology cannot be implemented due to technical reasons but can be faked, yet requires a limit value for entities. The value presented here shall be final infinite technology limit. 0 to disable furnace efficiency upgrade technology. Large numbers are not recommended!
fpf-furnace-upgrade-power-upgrade=Fake-Infinite Furnace Power upgrade bonus in MW per infinite technology researched (ex: 3 for +3MW)
fpf-furnace-upgrade-eff-upgrade=Fake-Infinite Furnace Efficiency upgrade bonus in % per infinite technology researched (ex: 5 for %5)
fpf-debug=Debug prints
fpf-logging=Log some messages and internal stuff to a log file
fpf-furnace-spawn-baserate=Base Furnace spawn rate (%) at every chunk explored and created
fpf-furnace-spawn-mindistance=Every furnace is far away from each other and after this distance, at every chunk explored the probability shall count 
fpf-furnace-spawn-rateincrement-perchunk=At every chunk distance to the existing furnaces, the probability shall increment by this value
fpf-namedentities=Every furnace type will have its power and effectivity in name. since all furnaces are updated at the same time it is not so important
fpf-spawn-warning=Game seems to have furnaces but setting for spawning furnaces seems to be off. Check settings to sync the behavior.
fpf-dont-disable-alternate-power=Keeps alternate Factorio power options enabled (like steam/nuclear power, solar energy)
fpf-spawn-enabled=Setting for spawning big furnaces is active! If you want to prevent it then uncheck setting and reload the game. 
fpf-spawn-disabled=Setting for spawning big furnaces is disabled! If you want furnaces to be spawned then check setting and reload the game.
